# Envsens API
This API is used to store the data provided by the ESP via Network Access.

The API can be run for testing by either executing `run.sh` or `python -m envsens --port <nr> --verbosity <level>` with the environment variables DB_PATH and TOKEN_PATH set to their respective files.

You can have a look at the available paths by navigating to `localhost:8080/docs` (default port when run via ./run.sh).
